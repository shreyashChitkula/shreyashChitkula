In computer programming, literals refer to fixed values that are directly specified in the code, as opposed to variables or expressions whose values are calculated at runtime.

For example, in the following line of code:

```java
int x=10;
```

the value "10" is a literal integer value, and it is assigned to the variable "x".

Other examples of literals in programming include:

* String literals, such as "Hello, world!"
    
* Boolean literals, such as true or false
    
* Character literals, such as 'a' or '\\n' (newline character)
    
* Floating-point literals, such as 3.14 or -0.25
    
* Null literals, such as null in Java or None in Python.
    

Literals are used extensively in programming to define constants, initialize variables, or provide input data for operations.

### Conclusion:

A literal is a value represented in the source code of a programming language
